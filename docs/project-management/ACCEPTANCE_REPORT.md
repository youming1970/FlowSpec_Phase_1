## Acceptance Test Execution Record

### Automated Test Results

```bash
# Build test
make build ✅

# Basic functionality test
./build/flowspec-cli --version ✅
./build/flowspec-cli --help ✅
./build/flowspec-cli align --help ✅

# End-to-end test
./build/flowspec-cli align \

## Identified Issues and Limitations

### Identified Issues

1. **JSONLogic Evaluation Logic** (Priority: Medium)
   - **Issue**: The logic for determining the result of an assertion evaluation needs optimization.
   - **Impact**: Functionality is available, but the interpretation of results is not accurate enough.
   - **Planned Fix**: v1.1.0

2. **Concurrency Safety Issue** (Priority: Low)
   - **Issue**: Data race in the performance monitoring module.
   - **Impact**: Does not affect core functionality, only performance statistics.
   - **Planned Fix**: v1.1.0

3. **Error Message Optimization** (Priority: Low)
   - **Issue**: The hint messages for some error scenarios could be more user-friendly.
   - **Impact**: User experience can be further improved.
   - **Planned Fix**: v1.2.0

### Current Limitations

1. **Language Support**: Currently only supports Java, TypeScript, Go.
2. **Trace Format**: Only supports OpenTelemetry JSON format.
3. **Assertion Language**: Only supports JSONLogic expressions.
4. **Output Format**: Only supports Human and JSON formats.
