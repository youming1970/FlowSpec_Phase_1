```bash
# 1. Build the project
make build

# 2. Check version information
./build/flowspec-cli --version

# 3. Check help information
./build/flowspec-cli --help
./build/flowspec-cli align --help

# 4. Run example tests
cd examples/simple-user-service
./test-example.sh
```

#### End-to-End Testing

```bash
# Success scenario
./build/flowspec-cli align \
  --path=examples/simple-user-service/src \
  --trace=examples/simple-user-service/traces/success-scenario.json \
  --output=human

# Failure scenario
./build/flowspec-cli align \
  --path=examples/simple-user-service/src \
  --trace=examples/simple-user-service/traces/precondition-failure.json \
  --output=json

# Error scenario
./build/flowspec-cli align \
  --path=nonexistent \
  --trace=nonexistent.json \
  --output=human
```

#### Performance Testing

```bash
# Run the performance test suite
make performance-test
